Our add-on provides the privacy essentials you need to seamlessly take control of your personal information, no matter where the Internet takes you: tracker blocking, smarter encryption, DuckDuckGo private search and more.","fullDescription":"Privacy, simplified.\n\nProtecting your privacy online is like protecting your home. Locking the front door won’t stop the most determined folks from getting inside, especially if you’ve left the back door and windows unlocked and an extra key under the doormat. That’s why we offer multiple types of privacy protection, most of which aren’t offered in most popular browsers by default.\n\nWith the press of a button, you get seamless protection from most 3rd-party trackers while you search and browse, access to tracking protections for emails you receive, and much more. Together these privacy essentials make more privacy your default.\n\nFEATURE HIGHLIGHTS\n\n    Search Privately by Default— DuckDuckGo Private Search comes built-in, so you can easily search the web without being tracked.\n    Escape Website Trackers Before They Load— automatically stop most hidden trackers (3rd-party scripts) from loading, which prevents companies from collecting and using (e.g. sale, ads, etc.) any data from these trackers. Our cutting-edge tracker blocking technology — called 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection – goes well above and beyond what you get in most popular browsers by default.\n    Automatically Enforce Encryption — force many sites you visit to automatically use an encrypted (HTTPS) connection, which helps shield your data from Wi-Fi snoopers and network onlookers like your Internet provider. Most popular browsers only direct users to encrypted versions of pages in specific circumstances, like when you navigate directly to a page in the address bar. We check our list of upgradable sites for all links you click.\n    Enable Built-in Email Protection — Over 85% of emails sent to Duck Addresses contained trackers that can detect when you’ve opened a message, where you were when you opened it, and what device you were using. Email Protection makes it easy to block most email trackers and hide your existing address when signing up for things online, all without switching email providers.\n    Escape Fingerprinting — help stop companies from creating a unique identifier for you by blocking their attempts to combine specific information about your browser and device settings.\n    Block Tracking Cookies— prevent most 3rd-party cookies from tracking you as you browse from site to site.\n\n\nADDITIONAL PROTECTIONS NOT AVAILABLE ON MOST BROWSERS\n\n    Link Tracking Protection — helps stop companies from gathering your browsing history and other information via personal identifiers embedded in the links you click on.\n    Embedded Social Content Tracking Protection — blocks embedded Facebook content around the web so they can't track you through their videos, posts, and comments found on other sites. You can easily unblock to view them if desired.\n    Google AMP Protection — forces sites to load content directly from publishers instead of using Google-owned links, which are full of creepy trackers.\n    Signal Your Privacy Preference with Global Privacy Control (GPC) — built-into our app, GPC intends to help you express your opt-out rights automatically by telling websites not to sell or share your personal information. Whether it can be used to enforce your legal rights (for example, current or future CCPA, GDPR requirements) depends on the laws in your jurisdiction.\n\n\nNote about our 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection following DuckDuckGo ad clicks: Our 3rd-Party Tracker Protection goes above and beyond what you get in most popular browsers by default, but we’re constantly working to make it more comprehensive. Currently, if an advertiser wants to detect conversions on their own website for our private DuckDuckGo search ads, our 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection will not stop bat.bing.com requests from loading on the advertiser’s website following DuckDuckGo ad clicks, but those requests are stopped in all other contexts. This is because DuckDuckGo private search advertising is in partnership with Microsoft. As part of that partnership, viewing ads on DuckDuckGo is anonymous and Microsoft has committed to not profile our users’ ad clicks.\n\nRead more about this and our Tracking Protections at https://help.duckduckgo.com/privacy/web-tracking-protections/\n\nYou don't need to wait to take back your privacy. Join the millions of people using DuckDuckGo and protect many of your everyday online activities with one app. It's privacy, simplified.\n\nAbout Us: https://duckduckgo.com/about/\nHow It Works: https://duckduckgo.com/app\nPrivacy Newsletter: https://duckduckgo.com/newsletter\nPrivacy Policy: https://duckduckgo.com/privacy/\nOpen Source: https://github.com/duckduckgo/duckduckgo-privacy-extension","weeklyDownloads":10870,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"DuckDuckGo","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/user/3946396/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/270/270986.png?modified=1669259560","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/270/270986.jpg?modified=1669259560","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/270/270978.png?modified=1669259560","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/270/270978.jpg?modified=1669259560","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/275/275629.png?modified=1669259573","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/275/275629.jpg?modified=1669259573","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/270/270980.png?modified=1669259560","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/270/270980.jpg?modified=1669259560","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/272/272621.png?modified=1669259560","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/272/272621.jpg?modified=1669259560","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.3683,"reviewCount":556,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/duckduckgo-for-firefox/reviews/","updateDate":1677071036000},{"id":"addon@darkreader.org","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/855/855413-32.png?modified=3f34e276","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/855/855413-64.png?modified=3f34e276","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/855/855413-128.png?modified=3f34e276"},"name":"Dark Reader","version":"4.9.62","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/4053589/darkreader-4.9.62.xpi","homepageURL":"http://darkreader.org/","supportURL":"https://github.com/darkreader/darkreader","description":"Dark mode for every website.

Since Oxford says some words are valid both ways, I kept both and the user decides which he prefers. A good example is: \"online\" and \"on-line\".\nFor ize/ise, both ways are accepted in some words.\nOxford Dictionaries will only refer that certain words accept both ize/ise for Premium accounts and not for regular users.\n\nPlaces from New Zealand/UK (England, Scotland, Wales & Northern Ireland):\nOn V2.61–2.64 I included tons of place names.\nMy scientist friend, Peter McGavin, told me that in NZ they use British, so I decided to do something about it. I did the same for UK. I searched on Wikipedia for \"towns\", \"counties\", \"villages\", \"boroughs\", \"suburbs\", etc.\nAlso, added places sent to me by Peter C.:\n© OpenStreetMap contributors: www.openstreetmap.org/copyright.\n© The Clergy of the Church of England Database Project, 2005.\n\nCities from Australia\nOn V2.65 I added the cities in Australia by population, since they are in valid English (Wikipedia).\n\nCities from US\nOn V2.65 I added tons of cities in the US with a 10 000+ population, since they are in valid English.\nThis list was supplied by Michael Holroyd on Kevin Atkinson's GitHub.\n\nCities from Canada\nOn V2.67 I added the cities in Canada, since they are in valid English (Wikipedia).\n\nState and union territory capitals in India\nOn V2.90 I added them to the dictionary, since they are in valid English (Wikipedia).\n\nCommon prescription and OTC drugs\nOn V2.63 I added tons of drugs names supplied by Andrew Ziem on Kevin Atkinson's GitHub.\nThe generic drugs (like \"diphenhydramine\") are in lowercase, while the brand names (like \"Abilify\") are capitalised.\n\nWords regarding COVID-19\nOn V2.83 I added tons of entries regarding the pandemic.\n\nMain difficulties developing this dictionary:\n1) Proper names;\n2) Possessive forms;\n3) Plurals.\nEDIT: https://proofingtoolgui.org/faq.html#issue1\n\nAdding new words:\nIf you believe to have found a missing/incorrect word, please send it to me for analysis. If it is on the Oxford or Collins dictionaries, I will add it.\n\nRemoving US words:\nIf you find American words, which appear both in Oxford and Collins dictionaries as such with a British correspondence, please send them to me for analysis and removal.\n\nArchaic words:\nI will only add archaic words if they don't interfere with other words.\n\n\nI developed Proofing Tool GUI (open-source tool) hoping someone would improve the GB speller, but months went by and no one volunteered, so I took the task myself in 2013.\n\nI have created the best up-to-date British speller. It encompasses several fields of knowledge, from simple to complex words.\n\nIt doesn't matter your religion, sex, age or academic background, everyone should have access to all words equally free.\n\nTo make sure the words I add are the correct ones, I have been looking for them in credible sources:\n1) Oxford Dictionaries;\n2) Collins Dictionary;\n3) Macmillan Dictionary;\n4) Cambridge Dictionary;\n5) Merriam-Webster Dictionary (used with caution ⚠);\n6) Wiktionary (used with caution ⚠);\n7) Wikipedia (used with caution ⚠);\n8) Physical dictionaries.\n\nIn January 2015, I purchased an \"Oxford Gold Account\" to have a higher access to Oxford Dictionaries.\n\nI am also involved on several projects with a specific jargon, having added some \"special\" words.\n\nI am adding the words with copy/paste after checking them in the dictionaries above. This is slower and harder, but the results are much better and accurate.\n\nOn 25.Aug.2013 I released a \"forked\" V2.00. The speller has been made available to OpenOffice, LibreOffice, Firefox, Thunderbird and SeaMonkey. So far, I have added 134 225+ words (as of V3.1.7).","weeklyDownloads":473,"type":"dictionary","creator":{"name":"Marco
